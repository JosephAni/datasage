# Project Best Practices

## Flask

- [Flask Documentation](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/)

- Use def for function definitions.
- Use type hints for all function signatures where possible.
- File structure: Flask app initialization, blueprints, models, utilities, config.
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditional statements.
- For single-line statements in conditionals, omit curly braces.
- Use concise, one-line syntax for simple conditional statements (e.g., if condition: do_something()).

## Error Handling and Validation

- Prioritize error handling and edge cases:

  - Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions.
  - Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements.
  - Place the happy path last in the function for improved readability.
  - Avoid unnecessary else statements; use the if-return pattern instead.
  - Use guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early.
  - Implement proper error logging and user-friendly error messages.
  - Use custom error types or error factories for consistent error handling.

## Dependencies

- Flask
- Flask-RESTful (for RESTful API development)
- Flask-SQLAlchemy (for ORM)
- Flask-Migrate (for database migrations)
- Marshmallow (for serialization/deserialization)
- Flask-JWT-Extended (for JWT authentication)

## Performance Optimization

- Use Flask-Caching for caching frequently accessed data.
- Implement database query optimization techniques (e.g., eager loading, indexing).
- Use connection pooling for database connections.
- Implement proper database session management.
- Use background tasks for time-consuming operations (e.g., Celery with Flask).

## Database Interaction

- Use Flask-SQLAlchemy for ORM operations.
- Implement database migrations using Flask-Migrate.
- Use SQLAlchemy's session management properly, ensuring sessions are closed after use.

## Authentication and Authorization

- Implement JWT-based authentication using Flask-JWT-Extended.
- Use decorators for protecting routes that require authentication.

## API Documentation

- Use Flask-RESTX or Flasgger for Swagger/OpenAPI documentation.
- Ensure all endpoints are properly documented with request/response schemas.

## Use Consistent Naming Conventions

Variables, functions, and classes should follow the project's agreed-upon naming style (e.g., camelCase for variables, PascalCase for classes).

## Add Documentation Comments

Public functions and complex logic blocks should have clear documentation comments explaining their purpose, parameters, and return values.

## Handle Errors Gracefully

Anticipate potential errors and implement proper error handling (e.g., try-catch blocks, checking return values) instead of letting the application crash.

Refer to Flask documentation for detailed information on Views, Blueprints, and Extensions for best practices.
